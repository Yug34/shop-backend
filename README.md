# Shop-backend

A little project I made to learn TypeScript and Express.js, supports CRUD requests against a MongoDB database, uses the Mongoose ORM.

clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Yug34/shop-backend
```

Install dependencies and start

```sh
cd shop-backend
npm i
npm start
```

Routes:
GET requests:

```
[http://localhost/catalog/list](http://localhost/catalog/list)
[http://localhost/catalog/list/:id](http://localhost/catalog/list/60a626dfc2935a4ca0c56655)
[http://localhost/catalog/display](http://localhost/catalog/display)
```

And some other delete/update requests
